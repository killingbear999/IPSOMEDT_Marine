%% Example: Plotting App That Opens a Dialog Box
% This app consists of a main plotting app that has a button
% for selecting options in a dialog box. The *Options* button
% calls the dialog box app with input arguments. In the dialog box, 
% the callback for the *OK* button sends the user's selections back to the main
% app by calling a public function in the main app.
